Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content	It has now been one week since we were transported to this wretched place! I think the gods have abandoned us! Of our monastery, the only building missing is the temple and its two resident priests! In its place, we have this weird construction, just out of reach of the pier, which we can't even enter. \n\nAll the survivors are scared. They are turning to me for comforting words, but I am only a novice, not yet ready to be a priest. Like them, I am a refugee who fled Sorr-Tarr and his vile servant.\n\nI do not know where we are, but we are far from home. Our little valley is a small pocket of Tirmar, lost - I don't know where!
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content2	Strange beasts roam the night, but for some reason they do not dare to enter our valley.\n\nI buried my daughter last night. She died as much from despair as from the rockslide and the earthquake. Now, I wait for my own end.\n\nTraveler - if you read this, say a prayer for our souls, for I cannot. I reject the gods whose folly brought us here! I curse them all!\n\nThe beasts have grown bolder, but they still avoid our valley. A pity, since I could use the meat. I am surviving on grain and vegetables, but solitude makes for hard labor and my strength is not what it was.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Abjuration_MonasteryJournal_Content3	It has been 40 years. I am the last one, an old man now! I buried them all - all! But I could not bring myself to give the last rites.

Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_Description	A locked book containing Aksha's notes since her arrival at the Keep.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text1	Lizzaria sent another party of her stupid zombies. One of them was an ogre, as if that would make things harder. Reek and Filth took care of it - I didn't even have to walk out. When will she understand that her attempts are useless? I'm getting tired of pretending to ignore who sends these monsters. I'm also getting tired of Mardracht. The old elf is powerful, for sure, but his mind is in decay. While he barricades himself in his solar, I've read all his damn books, but learned almost nothing.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text2	A Doom Gem. It took me forever to imbue it enough power to make it worthwhile. I still don't understand how the wizards of Manacalon could have done it in less than a year. Anyway, now I could use it to craft a nice weapon, but to what end? Killing Lizarria's zombies? I'm losing interest in the project now the difficult part is done. I don't need a magic dagger to make my enemies bleed.\n
=VACÍO
Equipment/&BoneKeep_Document_AkshasJournal_text3	Reek is a good minion. He used to be handsome, but undeath doesn't suit him. Now he's just an obedient little pawn. Who would guess he was once a nobleman? I kept his armor and shield - he doesn't need them any more. Filth was always scum, but now at least she is of some use. She brings corpses to feed the ghouls, so I don't have to walk through piles of rotting fools. I'm thinking of creating another Brood, though. A nice, meaty Brood of Flesh would be nice. Maybe next month.

The war is not over, and we must also face these Manacalons.\nThey wield magic as potent as that of any priest, yet the High Priest assures us that there are no gods in this world.\nThese are dark times, and they will test us, but this world is our last hope.\nMay the Lord of Valor watch over you, my love.\nArtus

Of course, only Laerin has the magical knowledge to complete the… miracle. Arun pardon me for this word, but what this elvish magic can accomplish is simply god-like. \nAlas, our troops are massing to besiege the Rift and stop the enemy once and for all. I am ready for my first magical weapon, a gift for my Lady Karyn. She is already a formidable fighter, but with the blade Laerin will enchant, she will be even more so. \nI have collected various enchantments, and I am not sure yet which one will please her most.

Equipment/&HectorLetterContent1	It was a bad plan; I said so from the start. It took me a month to master Griff's full appearance and a year to build the spider cult. The orcs are now loyal to me and eager to follow me to war, but the Scavengers have found the city and started encroaching on the orcs' territory. I decided to use the orcs ahead of schedule and wipe out the Scavengers. There were only a dozen of them, but they put up more of a fight than I expected, and I had to change the plan again. I sacrificed more orcs to capture their leader, a man named Hector. I will cancel the operation with the spider cult, and take the appearance of this Hector. A prominent member of the Scavengers could be useful. I must spend time alone with him deeper in the ruins, where the orcs don't go.

The mission is a complete failure and I will answer to the Tshar - if I survive. I will try to escape by climbing up the amphitheater, but the spiders might be too fast for me. Glory to Sorr-Tarr!

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content02	Surroundings, continued …castle architecture is of First Expansion style, with many repairs and additions. A standard founding plaque: "Caer Tenarion", built by the 25th Iron Legion in the 24th year of Gwaltrian the Third - year 1557 in the Manacalon calendar, or 1486 before the Cataclysm. Presumably built to pacify the surrounding area.

Equipment/&Necromancy_AngbisJournal_Content03	Later, same day. My initial impression confirmed: the castle is occupied. I encountered a patrol of skeletons led by a wraith who gave his name as Adam the Twelfth, a former Imperial officer and now captain of the castle's guard. He questioned me closely and gave me permission to research outside the castle, but not to approach the castle or try to enter. The lord, whose name he gave as Mardracht, does not receive visitors. Indeed, the captain admitted that he himself had not seen or spoken with his master in several centuries.

Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content01	On the New Magic of Humans and Their Gods, and Its Particular Implications for Necromancy. By Alithariel Threanin, Postulant Junior Master of the Arcaneum, School of Necromancy. Academic Session of 3044, Imperial Calendar
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content02	As my thesis in support of my candidacy for the rank of Junior Master of the Arcaneum at the School of Necromancy, I respectfully submit the results of my research into the nature and types of new magics brought to Solasta by the humans of Tirmar, in particular the effectiveness of those whom they call "clerics" in repelling and destroying undead creatures. This knowledge is of urgent importance as we struggle to understand these humans, and assess both the severity of the threat they may post to the Empire and the potential benefit they could bring to it once conquered.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content03	It is widely known that the magic of humans derives from the entities they call "gods" ("goddesses" in the feminine, and "deities" collectively). I call it "divine magic" in this thesis, to distinguish it from our own arcane magic that is the result of magical study. Just as arcane magic is organized into schools, some divine magic is comprised of eight areas of study, which the humans call "domains." Each deity typically provides its clerics with access to two domains, representing its particular interests. The domain that corresponds most closely to the School of Necromancy is called the Domain of Oblivion.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content04	In addition to spells from two domains, a cleric has access to a wide array of other spells and powers, which are common to all regardless of their patron deity. Many are broadly similar in their effects to the spells of the School of Necromancy. There are two necromantic powers, though, that are completely new and unique: a cleric of any Tirmarian deity, if their rank is high enough, can repel undead creatures and even destroy them. The humans I have questioned believe that this is because their deities regard all undead creatures as "unnatural" - a word that reveals much about their primitive level of sophistication - and therefore undesirable, but they seem to know nothing about the means by which this result is achieved, speaking only about the "will" or "power" of their deities.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Necromancy_Thesis_Content05	The following pages examine the phenomenon of "turning" and destroying undead using both the classical thaumatological approach of Fathirien and her successors, and the more modern methods championed by Gorlindrien and the Practicalists. All conclusions are tentative. If this thesis is accepted, I propose to make this phenomenon my primary research topic.

=VACÍO
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content01	…as the Soraks followed humanity, a high priest of Oblivion succumbed to despair and madness. He tainted the peace of the grave with the uncleanliness of undeath, raising the fallen to muster an army. As he knew this was not a prayer that would gain the favor of Maraike, the lady of life and death, he and his followers couched their plan in the form of a curse instead, tricking their goddess into ensuring that their plan would succeed. Maraike granted their plea, but was not deceived. She cursed the conspirators as well, for they had been corrupted by evil and were denied her grace. They became the fallen, and those they raised from death became sorrow zombies, named after the curse of sorrow that they had wrought.
=VACÍO
Equipment/&Necromancy_Fallen_Content02	Maraike's punishment ensured that none of the fallen could enjoy the touch of light without suffering and dying. They must forever skulk in the shadows until they repented. But Maraike's punishment was not all. Sorr-Tarr, the vile god of the Soraks, saw potential in the fallen. Without undoing Maraike's curse, he gave them powers to do evil: to corrupt others by their touch, and to create fouler servants than zombies. Of the original fallen not much is known, save that there were twelve of them, priests and paladins…

Equipment/&Necromancy_Refugees_Content02	The Governor received them with the appearance of kindness, reasoning that if they came as supplicant fugitives it would be an easy task to subdue them, and either set them to work as slaves alongside the inferior races of Solasta or bind them over to the wizards of the Arcaneum for dissection or whatever other form of study might prove most fruitful.

It was an "evil" deity and his followers - one Sorr-Tarr and the race of the Sorr-Akkath, or Soraks - who drove the humans to try to escape their home world of Tirmar, they say.

Equipment/&Abjuration_Dragons_Content01	There was a time, very long ago, when dragons were the rulers of Solasta. They lived in the mountains, close to volcanoes which they loved for their heat - for nothing else was hot enough to incubate a dragon's egg. At that time the dwarves had not yet come up from below ground, being more rock than flesh, and the halflings remained in their swamps, far from anyone. And what of the elves? The elves were in and of the air, without physical form but existing as swirling currents of air and mana, one with magic and with the world.

Ferocity and courage in battle were the highest values in their culture, so when the forces of our two worlds combined at the Battle of the Rift, it was these tribes who sought out the most dangerous locations in order to win the most glory by the values of their culture. This brought them very close to the Rift itself, and therefore made them most vulnerable to the unpredictable magical energies that flared out from it. All of those who fought beside them perished, even the elite of the Iron Legions - but somehow these barbarians, strong of mind and strong of body, were able to survive.

While our troops shed no tears over their fate, concern is spreading about this tree. I strongly recommend that some action be taken. We've chased dryads away from that tree.

Somewhat unusually, there was no attempt at bribery during this observation period. I might hope that he has learned better than to try it, but I suspect he plans to lull us into relaxing our guard. Not that we would do that after the mishap twenty years ago. The fate of that set of guards was a stark reminder of the price of shirking one's duty.
