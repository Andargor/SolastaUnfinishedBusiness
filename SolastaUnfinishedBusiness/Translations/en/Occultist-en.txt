Class/&WarlockVariantDescription=Where wizards draw their magical power from study and sorcerers from magical bloodlines, occultists or better known as warlocks gain power through a pact with a powerful patron: a fiend, perhaps, or some other powerful entity. Different than a warlock, occultists invest a lot of time on their studies and prefer to develop their intelligence instead of their charisma.
