If pressed into battle, bolgrifs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and nature magic.
[*]**Dark Elf**: Dark elves are descendants of elves that have been changed over time by living in the inhospitable Badlands. Dark elves are largely nocturnal and have become adapted to living in ancient Badlands ruins, especially buried underground ruins. They tend to have dark skin and pale hair.

Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.
[*]**Gray Dwarf**: The Gray Dwarves are dwarves who have been changed after only a few generations of exposure to the mysterious magics of the Badlands.

[*]**Dark Kobold**: Dark Kobolds are small reclusive creatures. Recently, some of the more advanced tribes of kobolds have chosen to reveal themselves and interact with other races. It is not a coincidence that this is happening at the same time as the dragonborn making themselves known, as the most advanced kobolds seem to in many ways mimic the dragonborn, even naming themselves in a similar style. They may even be more advanced than other kobolds due to intermingling with the dragonborn.
[*]**Draconic Kobold**: Draconic Kobolds are small reclusive creatures. Recently, some of the more advanced tribes of kobolds have chosen to reveal themselves and interact with other races. It is not a coincidence that this is happening at the same time as the dragonborn making themselves known, as the most advanced kobolds seem to in many ways mimic the dragonborn, even naming themselves in a similar style. They may even be more advanced than other kobolds due to intermingling with the dragonborn.
[*]**Asmodeus**: The tieflings connected to Nessus command the power of fire and darkness, guided by a keener than normal intellect, as befits those linked to Asmodeus himself.
[*]**Mephistopheles**: Mephistopheles offers arcane power to those who entreat with him. Tieflings linked to him master some arcane magic.
