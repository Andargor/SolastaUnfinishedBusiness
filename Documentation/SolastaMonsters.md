# 488. - Master Ilastar Keenmind Airgetine [DM: NPC]

Ilastar is a member of the noble house Airgetine, whose forefathers were wizards of the Arcaneum. As with many Imperial families of that time, his family was originally a minor branch of the clan and began to rise to prominence after the Cataclysm, as it backed the first Emperor ("The Wailing Emperor") who took the rough decisions ultimately leading to the survival of Civilization and to the rise of the New Empire. More than anybody else of his generation, Ilastar is aware of what was lost and was a major proponent of participating to the Council, in the hope of gathering magical materials and writings expanding his knowledge of magic and thus giving the empire an edge in future conflicts. His main worry is that historical documents come to the fore, revealing some truths better left alone.
